# Latest Changes Summary

## Changes Made (October 7, 2025)

### 1. âœ… Removed Test Readings from Database

**Problem:** Test readings with notes like "Test reading" and "API Test Reading" were showing up in history.

**Solution:** Cleaned up the database by removing all test readings:
```sql
DELETE FROM reading_attributes WHERE reading_id IN (SELECT reading_id FROM readings WHERE notes LIKE '%Test%');
DELETE FROM cards_drawn WHERE reading_id IN (SELECT reading_id FROM readings WHERE notes LIKE '%Test%');
DELETE FROM readings WHERE notes LIKE '%Test%';
```

**Result:** 
- Removed 3 test readings
- Removed 9 associated cards
- Removed 12 associated attributes
- Clean history with only real readings

### 2. âœ… Configured Sixel for Image Display

**File Modified:** `~/.config/iamb/config.toml`

**Change:**
```toml
# Before
protocol.type = "halfblocks"

# After
protocol.type = "sixel"
```

**Benefits:**
- Much better image quality for tarot cards
- Smoother rendering in supported terminals
- Works with: xterm, mlterm, wezterm, foot, and other sixel-capable terminals

**Note:** If your terminal doesn't support sixel, you can change it back to:
- `"halfblocks"` - Works in any terminal (Unicode blocks)
- `"kitty"` - For Kitty terminal (best quality)
- `"iterm"` - For iTerm2 on macOS

### 3. ðŸ“š Documentation: User ID Tracking System

**New File:** `USER_ID_TRACKING_EXPLANATION.md`

**Contents:**
- Complete explanation of how the recording system works
- Database schema breakdown
- Data flow diagrams for saving and retrieving readings
- Example data showing user isolation
- Current limitation explanation (hardcoded user ID)
- Future enhancement possibilities

**Key Points:**
- Each user is identified by their Matrix ID (e.g., `@waqaas:endlessperfect.com`)
- Readings are completely isolated per user
- API automatically creates users on first reading
- Analytics are calculated per-user only
- Currently hardcoded to one user, but infrastructure supports multiple users

## Current Status

### Working Features
- âœ… Clean database with no test data
- âœ… Sixel image display configured
- âœ… Auto-save on numeric spreads
- âœ… History commands send as room messages
- âœ… Analytics with bar graphs
- âœ… Per-user data isolation

### Known Limitation
- User ID is hardcoded to `@waqaas:endlessperfect.com`
- Needs proper context integration for multi-user support

## Testing

### Verify Clean Database
```bash
curl https://endlessperfect.com/tarot-api/api/readings/user/@waqaas:endlessperfect.com/history | jq
```

### Test Sixel Display
```bash
./target/release/iamb
# In a room with an image, it should display with better quality
```

### Test Recording
```bash
./target/release/iamb
# In a room:
:tarot 3
:tarothistory
# Should show only real readings, no test data
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified
- `~/.config/iamb/config.toml` - Changed to sixel protocol

### Created
- `USER_ID_TRACKING_EXPLANATION.md` - Complete system documentation
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Database
- Cleaned up test readings from PostgreSQL

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Multi-user Support:** Integrate proper user context to get actual Matrix ID
2. **Room Tracking:** Add room_id to readings for better organization
3. **Image Size Tuning:** Adjust sixel image size in config if needed
4. **Export Feature:** Add ability to export reading history
