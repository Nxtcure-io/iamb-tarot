Every form of energy in the card is spiral; this is in anticipation of the present Aeon, that of Horus, the crowned and conquering Child, successor to the ""dying god,"" Osiris. The departing Aeon is shown in the rectilinear forms of energy issuing from the lower cup. These forms stand for the now abandoned Euclidean geometry. The figure of the goddess may be taken as a manifestation of the surrounding space of Heaven."
Six of Swords,six_of_swords.jpg,Science,Mercury,Sol,Aquarius,,,Swords,,,Tiphareth,Air,,Science. Intelligence that has realized its goal. Labor. Work. Success after anxiety. Passage from difficulty. Journey by water. Ill-dignified: Selfishness. Conceit. Intellectual pride.,"Six of Swords = Science. Tiphareth in the suit of Air. Mercury in Aquarius. The ornamental hilts of the Swords form a hexagon in the card. Their points touch the outer petals of the red rose upon a Golden Cross of six squares. The perfect balance of mental and moral faculties, hardly won and impossible to hold, interprets the idea of Science."
Knight of Swords,knight_of_swords.jpg,,,,Gemini,Taurus,,Swords,Disks,,,Air,Fire,"Represents the fiery part of air. A man, active, skillful and clever, fierce, delicate and courageous but often unreflective. Ill-dignified: A man incapable of decision, deceitful, tyrannical and crafty.","Knight of Swords represents the fiery part of air, wind and storm; the violent power of motion applied to a manageable element.

The Priestess,the_priestess.jpg,,Luna,,,,,,,13.1.6,,,,"Pure, exalted and gracious influence enters the matter, hence change, alternation, increase and decrease, fluctuation. May be led away by enthusiasm unless careful balance maintained.","The Priestess. She is Isis, the eternal virgin, and again she is Artemis. It is for this reason she is clothed in the luminous veil of light, light being viewed not as the manifestation, but as the veil, of the spirit."
Lust,lust.jpg,,Uranus,Sol,Leo,,,,,19.4.5,,,,Courage. Strength. Energy. Use of magical power. Control of the life force. Great love affair. Resort to magic.,"Lust. This card was formally called Strength. It implies, however, not only strength, but joy in strength exercised. The seven heads of the lion are, respectively, that of an angel, saint, poet, adulteress, warrior, satyr, and lion-serpent. The central figure is the woman, who has surrendered herself to all the forces of creation and who rides astride of the Beast. In her left hand she holds the reins, as representing the passion which unites them, and in her right she holds aloft the Cup aflame with love and death. In this Cup are mingled the elements of the sacrament of the Aeon. In the background are the bloodless figures of the saints on whom this mirage travails, for their whole life has been absorbed into the Holy Grail."

Instability. Indecision. Union in a shallow degree with others. Superficiality.,"The Lovers. This specifically alchemical card is a symbol of procreation, the swords drawing attention to the process of division which actually takes place. Cain and Abel represent the refusal of God to hear the children of Eve until blood is shed. This seems to be the symbolisation of external religion. It was by means of the shedding of blood and of external religions that Cain was able to have contact with his fellow men. In that sense the meaning of the card is the giving of science to mankind, since the murder symbolises analysis and the subsequent contact, synthesis."
Three of Wands,three_of_wands.jpg,Virtue,Sol,Saturn,Aries,,,Wands,,,Binah,Fire,,Virtue. Established strength. Success after struggle. Pride and arrogance. Realization of hope. Nobility.

Ill-dignified: Learning or intelligence interfering with the matter in hand.,"The Magician or Juggler. Mercury, who is Wisdom.

The Adept's Wands are relegated to the background; in front is a crude, uneven club; the flames are dispersed. This shows degeneration of initial Energy, and departure from equilibrium."
Prince of Cups,prince_of_cups.jpg,,,,Scorpio,Libra,,Cups,Swords,,,Water,Air,"Represents the airy part of water.

Letter or message. Rapidity. Boldness. Freedom. Ill-dignified: Too much force applied too suddenly. A flash in the pan.,"Eight of Wands = Swiftness. Hod in the suit of Fire. Mercury in Sagittarius.

By the attribution of this card to the planet Jupiter, it is made to represent the Universe in its aspect of continual change. The appearance of all sorts of celestial phenomena emphasises this. In the middle is the ten-spoked wheel, the accepted symbol of Fortune. The three figures attached to the wheel symbolise the three forms of energy, expressed in the Hindu System by the term Guna. At the top sits the Sphinx, typifying intelligence and balance (Sativas); Hermanubis, in the semblance of an ape, represents the restlessness of brilliant, unstable reason (Rajas); and at the bottom, almost falling from the wheel, is the reptile-headed Typhon (Tamas), the symbol of destruction, sluggishness, and ignorance. The alchemical attributes of the Gunas are Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt."

Peace. Goodness of heart. Occult force voluntarily invoked.,"The Hierophant. The reference in this card is to Taurus the Bull and its Indian equivalent, the Elephant. The pentagram with its dancing male child symbolises the New Aeon of the child Horus, which takes the place of the Old Aeon that has governed us for 2,000 years. The Hierophant moves only at intervals of 2,000 years. The four masks are the guardians of every mystery, culminating in the Grand Mystery of the uniting of microcosm and macrocosm. The woman before the hierophant represents Venus, now armed and militant. The Wand with its interlaced rings shows the three Aeons of Isis, Osiris and Horus."

Subtlety and craft. Lying. Shame. Well-dignified: Obedience. Faithfulness. Patience. Unselfishness,","Nine of Swords = Cruelty. Yesod in the suit of Air. Mars in Gemini. The nine Swords are of different lengths, pointing downwards, poison blood drips from their jagged points. The background is studded with tears and crystal forms. In this card intellect is replaced by heartless passion."
Queen of Swords,queen_of_swords.jpg,,,,Libra,Virgo,,Swords,Disks,,,Air,Water,"Represents the watery part of air. A graceful woman, intensely perceptive, a keen observer, subtle interpreter, an intense individualist, confident, gracious and just. Ill-dignified: Cruel, sly, deceitful and unreliable woman. Superficial attractiveness makes her all the more dangerous.","The Queen of Swords represents the water part of Air, that is its elasticity and transmissive power. She is throned on the clouds, and her helmet carries a child's head. In one hand a sword, in the other a head of a man. She represents the clear perception of an idea, the Liberator of mind."

The Hanged Man,the_hanged_man.jpg,,,,,,,,,23.5.8,,Water,,Redemption through sacrifice. Enforced sacrifice. Suffering. Ill-dignified: Punishment. Loss. Defeat. Failure. Death.,"The Hanged Man or Dying God. The posture of the drowned or hanged man is of the greatest significance. The legs are crossed so that the right leg forms a right angle with the left leg, and the arms are stretched out at an angle of sixty degrees, so as to form an equilateral triangle. This gives the symbol of the triangle surmounted by a cross, which represents the descent of the light into darkness in order to redeem it. The whole idea of sacrifice is a misconception of nature, and the element of water to which the card is attributed is the element of illusion."
Five of Swords,five_of_swords.jpg,Defeat,Venus,Mars,Aquarius,,,Swords,,,Geburah,Air,,"Defeat. Loss. Malice. Spite. Weakness. Slander. Failure. Anxiety. Poverty. Dishonor. Trouble.

This card is very sensitive to dignity.,"The Moon. This card represents the state of impure horror, hidden darkness which must be passed through before light can be reborn. The Moon is, therefore, the most universal of the planets, partaking at once of the highest and the lowest. At the bottom of the card moves the Sacred Beetle, bearing the Sun through the darkness of night. Above is the evil landscape of the Moon. A stream, or path of Serum, tinged with blood, flows between two barren mountains. On the hills are dark sinister towers. On the threshold stands the jackal-headed god, Anubis, in double form; at his feet are the jackals waiting to devour those who have fallen by the way."

Rashness. Ill-temper.,"The Emperor. This card means Government by means of two contrasting symbols. These are the Ram, which, when wild, is solitary and courageous, and the Lamb, which is docile and cowardly, and is, in fact, the Ram tamed by authority. The posture typifies the Alchemical Sulphur, the fiery element of the universe. The Red Eagle represents the Red Tincture of the Alchemists, which is of the nature of gold."

He holds the male element of fire, the female element of water, the sword of air, and the disc of earth. He is the Green Man of Spring, the great Fool of the Celts, Daluah and Parsifal. He is also Zeus Arrhenothelus, Dionysus Zagreus, Bacchus Diphues and Baphomet."
Ace of Disks,ace_of_disks.jpg,,,,,,,Disks,,,Kether,Earth,,"The Root of the Powers of Earth. Material gain. Power. Labor. Wealth. Contentment. Materiality in all senses. For Crowley, this card was an affirmation of the identity of sun and earth, spirit and flesh.","The Ace of Disks represents the last of the feminine symbols; it is the twin sister of Air, and its bride. It is not only Earth, but matter as such. Per contra, the Disk is the whirling symbol of Space. The Disk is winged to indicate its spiritual origin."
The Aeon,the_aeon.jpg,,,,,,,,,31.8.10,,Fire,,Final decision concerning the past. New current for the future. Always represents the taking of a definite step.,"The Aeon, or the Angel, or the Last Judgment. The card is girt about with the body of Nuit, the star goddess, representing unlimited possibility. She surrounds the globe of fire, her mate, Hadit, standing for eternal energy. In the middle sits their child, Horus, also a solar deity, who is the incarnation of the New Aeon. The left hand, extended and empty, reminds us that the God has destroyed the old Universe, but is, as yet, too young to form its successor. At the bottom of the card appears the Hebrew letter, Shin, that is attributed to this card. The three Yods are occupied by three human figures arising to partake of the Essence of the New Aeon."
Ace of Wands,ace_of_wands.jpg,,,,,,,Wands,,,Kether,Fire,,The Root of the Powers of Fire. Energy. Strength. Force. Solar-phallic outburst of flame. Vigor.

The crystallization of the whole matter involved.,"The Universe. This card is attributed to the letter Tau. Together with the first card, the Fool, the word Ath is spelled, meaning Essence. Thus all reality is comprised in the series of which these two cards are the beginning and the end. The letter Tau symbolises a fourfold extension, applicable to the transcendence of space and time by a continually self-compensating change. The letter is further attributed to Saturn, the slowest of the planets, and on that account associated with the element of Earth. Saturn is the old god, the god of fertility. The presence of the letter Tau upon the Tree of Life indicates a state of equilibrium between change and stability. The glyph on the card, therefore, symbolises the completion of the Great Work. The image of the Universe is a maiden, the final letter of Tetragrammaton. She is represented as dancing with the Great spiral-forming Serpent or Sun. About her is an ellipse composed of seventy-two circles for the quinaries of the Zodiac. At the corners of the card are the four Kerubim, showing the established Universe. In the centre is the Wheel of Life, initiating the form of the Tree of Life, which is visible only to those of pure heart. On the lower part of the card is the late J. W. N. Sullivan's well-known map of the chemical elements."

A young woman, individualistic, brilliant and daring with great energy, sudden and violent in love or anger, enthusiastic.

Fulfillment of sexual will. Beginning of steady increase (but beginning only). Ill-dignified: Vanity. Presumptuousness. Thanklessness.,Six of Cups = Pleasure. Tiphareth in the suit of Water. Sun in Scorpio. The Lotus stems are grouped in an elaborate movement. Water gushes into them; they are full but not overflowing. This shows the influence of the Sun on Water.

Princess of Disks,princess_of_disks.jpg,,,,Taurus,Aries,Gemini,Disks,,,,Earth,Earth,"Represents the earthy part of earth.

May mean partial loss, dullness of mind with acuity and profit in money transactions. Heaviness.","Ten of Disks = Wealth. Malkuth in the suit of Earth. Mercury in Virgo.

The Sun,the_sun.jpg,,Sol,,,,,,,30.8.9,,,,"Glory. Gain. Riches. Triumph. Pleasure. Frankness. Truth. Shamelessness. Manifestation. Recovery from sickness, but sometimes sudden death. Ill-dignified: Arrogance. Vanity.","The Sun. This card represents the Lord of the new Aeon, the Lord of Light, Life, Liberty and Love, and the complete emancipation of the human race. The green mound represents the fertile earth, but the presence of a wall shows that the new Aeon does not mean the absence of control. The twin children are represented as dancing outside the wall, because they typify the new stage in human history, the stage of complete freedom from the restrictions imposed by such ideas as sin and death."
Queen of Cups,queen_of_cups.jpg,,,,Cancer,Gemini,,Cups,Swords,,,Water,Water,"Represents the watery part of water. A woman who reflects the nature of the observer, dreamy, tranquil, poetic, imaginative, kind yet not willing to take much trouble for another. She is much affected by surrounding influences, therefore more dependent than most other cards on good or ill dignity.","Queen of Cups = watery part of Water, or its power of reflection and reception. She is enthroned on still water, and carries a shell-like Cup containing a cray-fish. In her other hand she holds the Lotus of Isis."

Influence over another. Boldness. Courage, Fierceness. Ill-dignified: Restlessness. Turbulence. Obstinacy.",Two of Wands = Dominion. Chokmah in the suit of Fire. Mars in Aries. Here are two dorjes crossed. The dorje is the Tibetan symbol of destruction. But destruction may be regarded as the first step in the creative process.
The Devil,the_devil.jpg,,Mars,Saturn,Capricorn,,,,,26.6.8,,,,Blind impulse. Irresistibly strong and unscrupulous person. Ambition. Temptation. Obsession. Secret plan about to be executed. Hard work. Endurance. Aching discontent. Materialism. Fate.,"The Devil is here represented in the traditional form of the Goat. The cult of the Goat represents the impulse to reckless creation without any regard for result. Behind the Goat stands the Tree of Life, which pierces the Heavens in a medley of fantastic forms, recalling the markings on the planet Mars, always associated with the fiery material energy of creation. In the transparent roots the sap is seen, seething and leaping in every direction. The ring at the top is one of the rings of Saturn or Set, the Ass-headed god of the Egyptians. The spiral shape of the horns is an allusion to the highest and most remote things. Zoroaster defines God as ""having a spiral force."""

Art,art.jpg,,Dragon's Tail,Jupiter,Sagittarius,,,,,25.6.9,,,,Combination of forces. Realization. Action based on accurate calculation. Economy. Management. Success after elaborate maneuvers. The way of escape.,"Art, formerly called Temperance. The highest achievement of alchemy was the affecting of change, the transmuting of objects, qualities, colours and so on, into their opposites. Thus in this card the red lion has become white, the white eagle has become red. In the main figure, the black and white personages which were the Lovers in Card VI. are now interchanged and fused into an androgyne figure. This is the consummation of the Royal Marriage. The rainbow symbolises another stage in the alchemical process by the aura of many-coloured lights rising out of putrefaction. Putrefaction itself is shown by the raven perched on a skull on the cauldron. The consummation of the whole art of Alchemy is proclaimed in the glory with its inscription ""VISITA INTERIORA TERRAE RECTIFICANDO INVENIES OCCULTEM LAPIDEM."". The counsel to visit the interior of the earth is a recapitulation (on a higher plane) of the first formula of the Work. The important word is RECTIFICANDO, it implies the right leading of the new living substance in the path of the True Will."
The Hermit,the_hermit.jpg,,Mercury,Mercury,Virgo,,,,,20.4.6,,,,Illumination from within. Divine inspiration. Wisdom. Prudence. Circumspection. Retirement from participation in current events.,"The Hermit. The letter, to which this card is attributed, is the letter Yod, the foundation of all the other letters of the Hebrew Alphabet. The symbolism is that of the Creator of Life and his representative is the Spermatozoon. For that reason the card is called the Hermit. In the same order of ideas the Hermit holds the lamp whose centre is the Sun. The Egg, surrounded by the coils of a snake, typifies the Universe, while the snake signifies the fluidic essence of light, which is the life of the Universe. In this card are traces of the legend of Persephone. The serpent Wand, here seen growing out of the Abyss, is the Wand of Mercury, the guide of the soul through the lower regions. The letter Yod means ""a hand,"" and the hand is the centre of the design."
Six of Disks,six_of_disks.jpg,Success,Luna,Sol,Taurus,,,Disks,,,Tiphareth,Earth,,Success. Success and gain in material things. Power. Influence. Nobility. Philanthropy. Somewhat dreamy and transitory situation. Ill-dignified: Insolence. Conceit with wealth. Prodigality.,"Six of Disks = Success. Tiphareth in the suit of Earth. Moon in Taurus.

Victory after apprehension and fear. Illustrates the aphorism that ""change is stability.""","Nine of Wands = Strength. Yesod in the suit of Fire. Moon and Sagittarius. The Wands have become arrows, eight in number, and one Master arrow which has the Moon for its point, and the Sun for the driving force above it.

Six of Wands,six_of_wands.jpg,Victory,Jupiter,Sol,Leo,,,Wands,,,Tiphareth,Fire,,Victory. Energy in balanced manifestation. Love. Gain and success. Triumph after strife.

Ill-dignified: Covetousness. Theft. Knavery.,"Nine of Disks = Gain. Yesod in the suit of Earth. Venus in Virgo. The Disks are arranged as an equilateral triangle of three, apex upwards, surrounded by a ring. Six larger Disks form a hexagon. This signifies the multiplication of the original Word, the mingling of good luck and good management."
Adjustment,adjustment.jpg,,Saturn,Venus,Libra,,,,,22.5.6,,,,"Justice. Balance. Adjustment. Suspension of action pending decision. May refer to lawsuits, trials, marriages, treaties, etc.","Adjustment or traditionally Justice. This card represents the Woman satisfied. This condition is symbolised by the scales, in which she weighs the universe; Alpha, the first, exactly balances against Omega, the last. These scales represent the two 'witnesses.' Each 'witness' is an authentic manifestation of Maya, the one fulfilling the other by a process of contradiction, for nature is not Justice-she is rather through her process of equilibrium ""la Justesse."" Finally, this Woman is the original Harlequin, for the wild blend of colour and of movement resolves itself into an equilibrium of all possibilities of sensation."
Death,death.jpg,,Pluto,Mars,Scorpio,,,,,24.6.7,,,,"Transformation. Change voluntary or involuntary, perhaps sudden and unexpected. Apparent death or destruction that is illusory when viewed from a higher perspective.","Death. The alchemical sense of Death is not so much destruction as change. Thus we have, in this card, the Scorpion, representing primitive energy always ready to commit suicide (according to the legend) when heavily beset, but prepared to undergo any transformation which will permit its continued existence in a different form. The fish and serpent, here represented, have been objects of worship in cults which taught the doctrines of resurrection or re-incarnation. The central figure is executing the Dance of Death (skeleton and scythe are both Saturnian figures), and on his head he wears the crown of Osiris. The influence of Saturn is expressed in the negative aspect of Death as representing those essential forms which are not destroyed by the ordinary changes of nature; the positive and creative side is seen in the sweep of the scythe, which calls into being bubbles, symbolising new lives. The highest aspect of the card is the Eagle, which represents exaltation above solid matter."
Three of Cups,three_of_cups.jpg,Abundance,Mercury,Saturn,Cancer,,,Cups,,,Binah,Water,,"Abundance. Spiritual basis of fertility. Plenty. Hospitality. Pleasure. Sensuality. Passive success. Love. Kindness. Bounty. The good things of life, while they are to be enjoyed, are transient and therefore cannot be relied on.","Three of Cups = Abundance. Binah in the suit of Water. Mercury in Cancer. The Cups are pomegranates, bountifully overflowing in a calm sea, typifying the fulfilment of the Will to Love."
The Tower,the_tower.jpg,,Mars,,,,,,,27.7.8,,,,Quarrel. Combat. Danger. Ruin. Destruction of plans. Ambition. Courage. Sudden death. Escape from prison and all it implies.,"The Tower or the Blasted Tower, or the House of God. This card is attributed to the Hebrew letter Pé, which means a mouth. The card, which admits of two interpretations in one, is a manifestation in its rudest form, of pure destruction, the destruction of the old-established Aeon by lightning, flames, and engines of war. The other interpretation is drawn from the cult of Shiva. At the top of the card appears the Eye of Shiva. According to this, the card represents perfection, the perfection of annihilation by emancipation from the prison of organised life. The dove and the serpent represent the feminine and masculine impulses. In the language of Schopenhauer, ""The Will to Live and the Will to Die."""
Five of Cups,five_of_cups.jpg,Disappointment,Mars,Mars,Scorpio,,,Cups,,,Geburah,Water,,Disappointment. End of pleasure. Disturbance when least expected. Misfortune. Disappointment in love.

Ill-dignified: Violence in maintaining traditional ideas.","The Chariot. The four Sphinxes on this card, drawing the chariot, are the Bull, the Lion, the Eagle, and the Man, the whole representing the sixteen sub-elements. The function of the Charioteer is to bear the Holy Grail, in the centre of which is radiant blood, symbolising the presence of Light in Darkness."
Three of Swords,three_of_swords.jpg,Sorrow,Saturn,Saturn,Libra,,,Swords,,,Binah,Air,,Sorrow. Melancholy. Unhappiness. Tears. Disruption. Sowing of discord and strife. Delay. Absence. Separation. Mirth in forbidden pleasures. Deceit. Well-dignified: Singing. Faithfulness in promises. Honesty in money transactions.,"Three of Swords = Sorrow. Binah in the suit of Air. Saturn in Libra. The card represents the Great Sword of the Magician, point uppermost, cutting the junction of the two short swords. The background shows crystallisation and storm. This is the darkness of the Great Sea."
Ace of Swords,ace_of_swords.jpg,,,,,,,Swords,,,Kether,Air,,"The Root of the Powers of Air. Invoked force as contrasted with natural force (compare Ace of Wands). Represents great power for good or evil but invoked. Conquest. Whirling force. Activity. Strength through trouble. As affirmation of justice upholding divine authority, may become sword of wrath, punishment and affliction.","Ace of Swords. This card represents the first of the mixed elements, and is the result of the Union of Water and Air. In the centre is a sword implying kingship, which pierces a crown with twelve points for the twelve signs of the Zodiac."
Nine of Cups,nine_of_cups.jpg,Happiness,Jupiter,Luna,Pisces,,,Cups,,,Yesod,Water,,"Happiness. Complete success. Pleasure and happiness. Physical well-being. Happiness almost perfect but perhaps temporary. Ill-dignified: Danger of vanity, self-praise, conceit and overindulgence.",Nine of Cups = Happiness. Yesod in the suit of Water. Jupiter in Pisces.
